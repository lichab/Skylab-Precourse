# Skylab Airlines

First small js project simulating a small console airline interface.  First we show some information to the user.
After that depending on the user being ADMIN or USER we have the ability to different things.
ADMIN > - Add flights (Max 15).
        - Remove flights.
USER >  - Search flights by price.
